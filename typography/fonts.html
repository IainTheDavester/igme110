        <h1>Kids have names?</h1>
        <p>I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</p>
        <p>Then we'll go with that data file! <strong> Now what?</strong> <em> Fatal.</em> Why not indeed!</p>
        <h2>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</h2>
        <p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>No, just a regular mistake.</li><li>No argument here.</li><li>No argument here.</li>

        <h3>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</h3>
        <p>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Bite my shiny metal ass.</li><li>Negative, bossy meat creature!</li><li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I wish! It's a nickel. Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Shut up and take my money! No! The cat shelter's on to me. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
        <p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
        <p>Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
        <p>Moving along… I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
        <p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</p>
        <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p>
        <p>Do a flip! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Actually, that's still true.</p>
        <p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Is that a cooking show? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Pansy. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
        <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Large bet on myself in round one. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
        <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. With gusto. What are their names? I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
        <p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. How much did you make me? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</p>
